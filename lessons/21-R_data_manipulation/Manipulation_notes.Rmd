# Introduction to data manipulation with `dplyr` intro

(Will, 11:15 - 12:15)

## Motivation

Data is never organized in the way you want it 

High % of project is data wrangling

Many many many modern jobs are data wrangling

## Key ideas

Data is a noun

Actions on data are verbs  

Learn a few key verbs and what they do

read_csv
filter
select
mutate
arrange

group_by
summarise
count 
n

rename

the `join` family

Pipes

 - use the operator `%>%` 
- If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with Ctrl + Shift + M if you have a PC or Cmd + Shift + M if you have a Mac.

- [Datacarpentry's lesson on data manipulation](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html)
- [The `tidylog` package](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog) is cool for understanding what happens with dplyr operations

# Data visualisation

## Generate hypotheses

- Using dataset from 1st half day, discuss in groups a plot you'd like to make
- Report idea to group

Sydney beaches data


**Exercises:**

(revise) Challenge - basic ggplot:

1. Load a new dataset
2. Choose a plot type, and plot something
3. Set a colour/fill/shape aesthetic
4. Choose a theme
5. Choose a facet if applicable, or scale one of your aesthetics
6. Assign the plot to an object
7. Save the plot as a couple different file formats
