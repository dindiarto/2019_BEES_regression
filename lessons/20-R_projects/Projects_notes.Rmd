## Motivation

Live is complicated, and I used to be in pain, but now I live a blissful peaceful happy existence with no worries aside from feeding unicorns.

**Exercise:**

Challenge - path names:

1. Use the `dir` function to list contents of a folder

Challenge - projects:

1. Create an organized project directory for this stats course
2. Include an RStudio Project in the folder
3. Download the course data (from Moodle or github)
4. Create a file something like 'R_day1.R' 
5. Write one line of code to make a variable, and then save the object as a .rds file
